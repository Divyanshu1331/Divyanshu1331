# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Divyanshu Gupta  

I am passionate about *Artificial Intelligence* and especially *Computer Vision*. I enjoy learning, exploring, and applying deep learning methods to vision problems, with the long-term goal of becoming a researcher in this field.  

I share my deep learning journey on [Medium](https://divyanshu1331.medium.com/), where I write about my **learning, experiments, and insights**. I also maintain two repositories:  

- [Deep Learning Journey](https://github.com/Divyanshu1331/Deep-Learning-Journey) â€“ blogs, code, and notebooks.  
- [CV Research Projects](https://github.com/Divyanshu1331/cv-research-projects) â€“ implementations and experiments in computer vision.  

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on strengthening my deep learning foundations, working on vision projects, and preparing for future research opportunities in AI and Computer Vision.
